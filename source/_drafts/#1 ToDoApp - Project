# Purpose

This projects purpose is to be an educational expericance.
I like to learn the proper use of Angular in combination with Firebase and also how to apply the clean code architecture approach.

The "simplest" kind of app for such purpose was to try to implement a ToDo app. A ToDo app checks all the basic needs to test out a clean code architecture with Angular and allows the proper use of Firebase for database access and user management.

# Goals

The goal is to have a Todo app where each user has its own list of task. Where a task has a title maybe some details and a due date.
